# Dice-Randomize-app
This is a beginner level IOS app developed by my growing knowledge through different sources about IOS app development. Here the app gives random numbers when user clicks roll button to get random numbers in the two dice provided. The app is flexible and can be used in portrait and  landscape mode.
